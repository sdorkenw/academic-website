abstract: Due to advances in automated image acquisition and analysis,
  whole-brain connectomes with 100,000 or more neurons are on the horizon.
  Proofreading of whole-brain automated reconstructions will require many
  person-years of effort, due to the huge volumes of data involved. Here we
  present FlyWire, an online community for proofreading neural circuits in a
  Drosophila melanogaster brain and explain how its computational and social
  structures are organized to scale up to whole-brain connectomics.
  Browser-based three-dimensional interactive segmentation by collaborative
  editing of a spatially chunked supervoxel graph makes it possible to
  distribute proofreading to individuals located virtually anywhere in the
  world. Information in the edit history is programmatically accessible for a
  variety of uses such as estimating proofreading accuracy or building incentive
  systems. An open community accelerates proofreading by recruiting more
  participants and accelerates scientific discovery by requiring information
  sharing. We demonstrate how FlyWire enables circuit analysis by reconstructing
  and analyzing the connectome of mechanosensory neurons.
