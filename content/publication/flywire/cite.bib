  abstract = "Due to advances in automated image acquisition and analysis,
              whole-brain connectomes with 100,000 or more neurons are on the
              horizon. Proofreading of whole-brain automated reconstructions
              will require many person-years of effort, due to the huge volumes
              of data involved. Here we present FlyWire, an online community
              for proofreading neural circuits in a Drosophila melanogaster
              brain and explain how its computational and social structures are
              organized to scale up to whole-brain connectomics. Browser-based
              three-dimensional interactive segmentation by collaborative
              editing of a spatially chunked supervoxel graph makes it possible
              to distribute proofreading to individuals located virtually
              anywhere in the world. Information in the edit history is
              programmatically accessible for a variety of uses such as
              estimating proofreading accuracy or building incentive systems.
              An open community accelerates proofreading by recruiting more
              participants and accelerates scientific discovery by requiring
              information sharing. We demonstrate how FlyWire enables circuit
              analysis by reconstructing and analyzing the connectome of
              mechanosensory neurons.",
